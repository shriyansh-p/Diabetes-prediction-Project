1) Project Description
This project predicts diabetes in patients based on their health metrics using machine learning. It preprocesses data from a dataset, scales features, and uses an SVM classifier to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. The model achieves high accuracy by training on a balanced set and optimizing with StandardScaler. It provides predictions for custom inputs, making it useful for early diagnosis support.

2) Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
Algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Dataset: Diabetes dataset

3) Challenges Faced
Data Imbalance: Ensuring balanced data during training was challenging due to the varied distribution of diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
Feature Scaling: Proper feature scaling was essential to prevent certain features from dominating others in the SVM model.
Model Generalization: Achieving an optimal trade-off between training and test accuracy to avoid overfitting on the training set.

4) Future Scope and Improvements
Enhanced Feature Engineering: Adding more health indicators and derived metrics could improve model accuracy.
Alternative Algorithms: Experimenting with other algorithms like Random Forest or Neural Networks might yield better predictive performance.
Deployment: The model can be deployed as a web app or mobile application for accessible real-time predictions.
Cross-validation: Using k-fold cross-validation can ensure the modelâ€™s stability and better generalize across unseen data.
